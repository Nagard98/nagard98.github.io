I am a recent **Computer Science** graduate with a strong interest in real-time rendering. Throughout my studies, I’ve been captivated by the technical and creative aspects of computer graphics, particularly in real-time applications like gaming and interactive simulations. 

My academic journey has been diverse, beginning with my **Bachelor's degree** in IoT, Big Data & Web, where I focused on robotics and automation. My thesis, titled **"Automated use of underwater ROVs for seabed exploration and object recognition,"** gave me valuable experience in developing autonomous systems and object recognition technologies.

As I pursued my **Master's degree** in Computer Science, my focus shifted towards computer graphics and real-time rendering. My thesis, **"Simulation of translucency in real-time using dynamic sampling based on local contrast,"** allowed me to explore advanced techniques for simulating translucency, particularly through **subsurface scattering**. I also gained hands-on experience working with **DirectX11**, further deepening my understanding of real-time rendering.

Now, I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned to real-world projects, continually improving and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of visual realism.
