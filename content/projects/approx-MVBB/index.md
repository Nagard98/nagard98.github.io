title: "Approximate MVBB Visualizer"
summary: "Tool for computing and visualizing an approximate Minimum Volume Bounding Box (MVBB) given a 3D Model. The algorithm is based on the ''**Efficiently Approximating the Minimum-Volume Bounding Box of a Point Set in Three Dimensions**'' paper from Barequet and Har-Peled. For some internal algorithms I used those provided with the CGAL library."
